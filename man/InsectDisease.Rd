This package provides a `R` workspace with insect disease database data already
present. Data are visible by using the R command ls("package:InsectDisease")`, and individual
data frames can be imported to your local workspace by using the command `data(NAMEOFDATA)`


Data frames can be grouped by parasite type, as `nemaref`, `nematode` and `newnema` provide information on nematode infections, as `nvpassoc` provides information on protozoans, and `viraref` and `viruses` provide details of viral infections. `pathogen` provides general taxonomic information on pathogens in the database. Citations are available in a number of places, including but not limited to `assocref`, `citation`, `nemaref`, and `viraref`.
