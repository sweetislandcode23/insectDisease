insectDisease 1.2.2
==============

changed `getNCBI` function to have more internal error handling. Now two `try` statements are used with catches to stop if the web resource is unavailable. Definitely better than the previous error. 


insectDisease 1.2.1
==============

Reviewer comments came back. Suggestions include some further README documentation, releasing the package through CRAN, updating Zenodo link (adding .zenodo.json file, and changing license). 



insectDisease 1.2.0
==============

In response to reviewer suggestions, we did a bunch of work. Added unit tests, expanded README, `data-raw` folder with processing script to work with odd date issues and unicode characters, etc. The data are much cleaner and more usable than they were previously. 


insectDisease 1.1.0
==============

Initial release of data along with host and pathogen taxonomic data incorporation.
