### *insectDisease*: insect disease data from the USDA's Ecological Database of the World's Insect Pathogens

[![R build status](https://github.com/viralemergence/insectDisease/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/viralemergence/insectDisease/actions)





David Onstad from the USDA provided us with this USDA-gathered insect disease database, sometimes referred to as the "Ecological Database of the World's Insect Pathogens" or EDWIP. Files have been converted from SQL to csv, and ported into R for easy exploration and analysis. 




### Install

Install from GitHub using the code below. 


```r

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("viralemergence/insectDisease")
