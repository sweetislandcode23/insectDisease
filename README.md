### *insectDisease*: insect disease data from the Ecological Database of the World's Insect Pathogens

[![R build status](https://github.com/viralemergence/insectDisease/workflows/R-CMD-check/badge.svg)](https://github.com/viralemergence/insectDisease/actions)


This is a database of known pathogens of many species of insects and other arthropods. This database was designed by David Onstad, and first described in Braxton et al (2003). The database is somewhat unique in that in addition to host-parasite associations that occur in nature, it also contains some true host absences: records of instances where a given host species was inoculated with a pathogen and found not to be susceptible to it. This database also contains a large amount of ecological data on hosts and parasites. Here, we document and preserve these data as an R package, also providing csv flatfiles in the `csv` folder and an [interactive web platform](https://edwip.ecology.uga.edu/download)


### Install

Install from GitHub using the code below. 


```r

# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("viralemergence/insectDisease")
library("insectDisease")

```






### vignette

The raw data can be called using the `data()` function on the various files within the `R` folder. In the `vignette` folder, there is some code that cleans, processes, and taxononymizes the data.
