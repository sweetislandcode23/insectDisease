\section*{Introduction}


% the lack of insect disease data
There are a number of data sources documenting host-pathogen associations, especially for pathogens of mammals \citep{gibb2021, patrick2017}, birds \citep{bensch2009}, and fish \citep{fishpest}. These have been incredibly important to our understanding of what determines pathogen host range, pathogen species richness across a set of hosts, and overall host-pathogen network structure (e.g, \citep{dallas2018, carlson2020}). But while some host groups are well-studied, there are taxonomic gaps in our understanding of host-pathogen associations. For instance, insect host-pathogen relationships have considerably less open-source data available, despite their inherent importance to agricultural crops and vector-borne disease, in addition to the numerical dominance of insect species over other taxa \citep{stork2015}. This is a clear knowledge gap. 






% the file drawer issue and
\paragraph*{}
Additionally, all of the previous data sources listed before have dedicated researchers and government agencies responsible for data deposition and curation in openly accessible formats. However, some data have not been as lucky, at no fault of the original data curators. These data run the risk of disappearing into a file drawer or on an external hard drive, potentially shared with a small number of researchers but not accessible to the scientific community at large. One data resource arguably close to this point of disappearance is the \textit{Ecological Database of the World's Insect Pathogens} (EDWIP) \citep{onstad1997}. 



% edwip
\paragraph*{}
The EDWIP data consist of experimental infections and field observations of the interactions between insect hosts and a number of nematode, viral, protozoan, fungal, and bacterial pathogens \citep{braxton2003}. In the EDWIP data, a number of pathogen infection types were excluded, including vector-borne pathogens which do not infect the insect host. An interesting component of EDWIP is the existence of negative associations -- attempts to inoculate a host with a given pathogen that failed to infect -- for some host groups (Figure \ref{fig:bubble}). Failed infections represent \textit{true} absences or incompatibilities between a given host and pathogen. These data are incredibly useful to pathogen host range and host-pathogen interaction modeling, but we rarely have data on these known non-interactions. Initially created in 1996, the data have been dynamically updated over time. However, it is unclear how long this curation continued, and how many different versions of the data may be in existence without proper versioning. To this point, the numbers of insect-host pathogen interactions differs slightly from previously published versions of the data \citep{braxton2003}, but these changes are relatively minor. 



\subsection*{Solution statement}

To preserve these data in a format that is well-documented, openly accessible, versioned, and flexible for continued development, we created the \texttt{insectDisease} R package. In doing so, we implicitly adhere to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Resuable) guidelines for managing data. By hosting the data openly on GitHub, and versioning releases of the data with a permanent identifier (DOI), we ensure the longevity and versioned curation of this data resource. Finally, the incorporation of taxonomic data through \texttt{taxize} \citep{chamberlain2013} makes sure that host and pathogen taxonomic names are updated. 


















\subsection*{Data specification}

% Discuss more of the in-depth view of the R package as a means for data delivery, and what the overall workflow looks like. Discuss how it's open and all part of the Verena ecosystem (or whatever). Flex on data size and point to figures displaying the positive and negative associations and such. 


\paragraph*{Package structure}

Data products are broken down by pathogen group; nematodes (\texttt{data(nematode)}), viruses (\texttt{data(viruses)}), and non-viral pathogens, which include protozoan, fungi, and bacteria (\texttt{data(nvpassoc)}). Data on negative associations is stored collectively instead of being delineated by pathogen group (\texttt{data(negative)}), but information on pathogen group is provided within each of these files, allowing for sorting of negative interactions based on the initial pathogen groupings. 


\paragraph*{}
Each of the pathogen groups slightly differs in the available data on experimental infections. For instance, nematode infections contain information on soil type and associated bacteria, virus infection data has information on viral dose, and non-viral pathogens (protozoans, fungi, and bacteria) have information on intermediate host species.


\paragraph*{}
Data are also available on the insect host species themselves (e.g., \texttt{data(hosts)}). These data contain some information on Canadian province where the host is found (\texttt{ProvinceI} column), what it eats (\texttt{Food} column), and what type of habitat it is found in (\texttt{Habitat} column). Additionally, a column on host insect pest status is present, offering the opportunity to explore study effort and pathogen specificity dependent on the pest status of the insect host. 











\paragraph*{Metadata and package documentation}

Differences in features across the data on different pathogen types (e.g., \texttt{?nematodes} relative to \texttt{?viruses}) make combining these data difficult without a loss of information. However, there is clear utility in having all of the data in a single standardized form. As such, we have documented each data resource using R package documentation, allowing the metadata of each data product to be examined directly from R using the \texttt{help()} function or the question mark notation (e.g., \texttt{?viruses}). 














\paragraph*{Data cleaning and taxonomic resolution}

We attempted to maintain as much of the original data structure from the raw data files provided by David Onstad, principal maintainer of the EDWIP data resource \citep{onstad1997}. This includes files such as \texttt{new\_assoc}, as this was likely a test file containing pathogen species such as "wormy thing". We provide comments in the documentation about which data sources are perhaps more trustworthy. We clean and augment this existing data source programmatically, with much of this code in the \texttt{insectDisease} package \texttt{vignette}.



\paragraph*{}
The first, and perhaps most important augmentation, is the resolution of host and pathogen taxonomic information. We achieved this by using the R package \texttt{taxize}, specifically the NCBI taxonomic backbone \citep{chamberlain2013}. Cached versions of host and pathogen taxonomic information are provided (\texttt{data(hostTaxonomy)} and \texttt{data(pathTaxonomy)}), and the $R$ code to generate these taxonomic backbones and clean the data are provided in the package vignette. This taxonomic backbone serves to both standardize host and pathogen nomenclature, while also correcting any taxonomic changes that have occurred in the past couple decades. This includes the consideration of microsporidian parasites as fungi, not protozoans, a change affecting a large set of records in the EDWIP data. Second, we provide a vignette which transparently shows the steps to clean and augment the data resource, as well as reproduce figures from this manuscript. Further, the vignette includes code which generates host-pathogen associations for all the data combined into a single data resource, simplifying the data down to a small number of important columns. Finally, processed we opt to store raw data in the \texttt{csv} folder, which contains all raw data files in .csv format. These data are also provided as .rda files in the \texttt{data} folder. This allows non-$R$ users to access the csv-formatted data easily, and ensures long-term stability of the data, as \texttt{csv} is a stable text file format.





















\subsection*{Case study: covariance among pathogen groups in parasite species richness }

Hosts that are infected by more pathogens of one type may also be more infected by pathogens of another type, mediated by host life history traits, metabolic demands, geographic distribution, and intensity of scientific study \citep{dallas2021}. We explore this in the EDWIP data by measuring the number of known positive associations of each of the pathogen groups for each insect host species, visualizing the relationship between the number of pathogens per insect host as a correlation matrix (Figure \ref{fig:corPlot}). We find very little evidence that pathogen groups have positive covariance, which would be expected if host species traits drove infection process across pathogen groups in the same manner. The failure to detect positive relationships, and indeed some negative relationships appearing, could be a signal of the targeted nature of data collection, as many insect host species were selected to study due to their potential as a crop pest, and many pathogens were selected to study based on their potential use as biocontrol or perhaps for their ease of culture. 

\paragraph*{}
This potential sampling bias among insect host species would be clear if there were a positive relationship between the number of positive interactions to the number of negative interactions for a host species, as it would indicate that insect host species with lots of known interactions also tended to appear in many studies and have some negative interactions as well. We find evidence for a significantly negative relationship based on a Spearman's rank correlation ($\rho$ = -0.1, p $<$ 0.0001). 





















\subsection*{Concluding comments}

Ecological data -- while growing in availability, size, and stability -- are still a resource that should not be allowed to fade out of existence. The EDWIP data provided to the authors were in a proprietary format ('Claris FileMaker Pro 5') that was already over 10 major versions behind. With limited inter-version operability (e.g., \texttt{.fmp5} files cannot be opened in more recent versions of the software, or require multiple conversion steps), these data seemed as if headed towards obsolescence. The \texttt{insectDisease} package ensures that these data will be available to the broadest set of researchers, be bound to relevant metadata, and be properly versioned. By hosting the data openly, we welcome contributions from researchers interested in augmenting the data or building off the existing resource. 







\subsection*{Data accessibility}

The \texttt{insectDisease} R package is currently available on GitHub https://github.com/viralemergence/insectDisease, with '.csv' files in the csv directory for long-term data stability. 

Finally, the data are periodically archived at major version changes via Zenodo ??????????????????
