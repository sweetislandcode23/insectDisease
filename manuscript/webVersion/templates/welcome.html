  <h2>Ecological Database of the Worldâ€™s Insect Pathogens</h2>

  <p>
    This is a database of known pathogens of many species of insects and other arthropods. This database was designed by Davide Onstad, and first described in Braxton et al (2003).  The taxonomy of these data follows that of the original publication.   The database is somewhat unique in that in addition to host-parasite associations that occur in nature, it also contains some true host absences: records of instances where a given host species was inoculated with a pathogen and found not to be susceptible to it.  This database also contains a large amount of ecological data on hosts and parasites.
  </p>
  <p>
    Feel free to use these data, which are provided without any warranty of accuracy or completeness (save that most of the originally published data are here), for whatever you wish.  We simply ask that you cite Braxton et al. (2003) in any publication using the data.  We have made as much of the database as we could available here.  However if you would like a copy the full database as a series of flat csv files, please contact Patrick Stephens  < prsteph AT uga.edu >.
