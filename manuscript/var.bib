They found that the qualitative effects of noise colour didn't differ with the degree of subpopulation synchrony. The redder the noise colour (more autocorrelated env. noise) the lower the extinction risk. They looked at the influence of noise colour for both overcompensatory and undercompensatory dynamical populations, finding a hump shaped relationship; less responsive (undercompensatory populations) have highest extinction risk at intermediate noise colour. They do a good job discussing the relationship of how extinction risk depends on population dynamics, noise colour and the degree of synchrony.",

We argue that the common practice of assuming perfect environmental tracking may result in overemphasizing the importance of noise colour for extinction risk.",
